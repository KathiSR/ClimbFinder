Twilight Zone,h.

Much of the gear is still fixed, or at least it was when I got on it in 2004.* It is also recommended as a good route for practicing clean aid, because it's safe but wildly exposed -- lots of hang time. ,That is how I went up it, as a night-time rope solo. Finding the old fixed pieces by headlamp, often with antique 'biners hanging off them, felt like a treasure hunt. Rather than trying to clean it by rappelling and/or down-climbing, I fixed the middle of my rope (70m) at the top, descended the free end, and followed the GTL back to my ground anchor (a tree). Then I partly jugged and partly re-climbed the route, cleaning as I went, and rapped Arrow. ,P1: From the GT ledge, climb the face just right of the hollow right-facing corner above P1 of ,, or climb inside the corner/chimney until you can traverse out and up left to the first roof section.

The final pitch of , starts from this same terrace. ,The pitch begins a few feet right of a large right-facing corner and goes mostly up, with some trending to the right, for about 35’ to a small overhang with an old pin above and to the left of it. This section is 5.7 or so and is slightly run-out. ,Next, head right past an overhang, then continue to move right and slightly upward for a few feet until you can traverse straight to the right for about 35’. A hanging belay can be built at the end of that traverse, at the intersection of a flake and a vertical crack/corner.

South West Ridge,"Peak 11,300","Mixed, Snow, Alpine, 4100',  Grade VI",Alaska,"Description ,This classic route deserves a spot on every aspiring alpine climber's to-do list. The ridge offers sustained moderate difficulty with over 4000 ft of vertical rise in an amazing setting. The rock quality is generally good and objective danger acceptably low. ,Joe Puryear's guidebook has a very detailed description and topo. Here's a summary that's meant to supplement that description. ,- Start on the LHS of the ridge at 7,000'. Climb 40-50 degree snow for about 1,000' to reach the ridge crest at a level section (some people have bivvied here). ,- Between 8,000' and 9,000' climb a series of rock steps (up to 5.8) with moderate-angle snow in between. Traverse left or right as necessary to find the easiest line. Partway up this section move left around the ridge crest (exposed) and climb the ""Thin Man's Squeeze"", a narrow chimney between two large blocks. Then climb a short 5.8 pitch on the RHS of a large headwall to reach a snow ramp that descends to the 1st col (good bivy site, but look out for crevasses). ,- From the 1st col climb a steeping snow/ice slope (up to 55 degrees), then follow a snow arete and traverse L into a snow gully, the ""S-Couloir"". Part-way up the couloir at 9,700' is the ""Grey Rock"". Underneath this is a bivy ledge with enough room for two 2-person tents. ,- Continue up the S-Couloir and climb a short 5.8 rock pitch on the RHS of ""The Thumb"" (large pinnacle). Downclimb and traverse to a rappel station, then rap 100' into the 2nd col at 10,000'. With enough snow it may be possible to dig a tent platform here. Beware of cornices. Retreat would be difficult once you've rapped into the col. ,- From the 2nd col climb a rock face and an awkward L-leaning crack (""The Slot"", 5.8, technical crux). Follow a corniced snow ridge for a couple of rope-lengths to a small pinnacle. Puryear's guidebook cover photo was taken from here. Downclimb 40' to the right (Puryear's guidebook say to rappel), then climb a short mixed gully (not as steep as it looks from the pinnacle). Continue up the final rock pitch (5.8). Exit R near the top. ,- Continue up a a snowy ridge, traverse R to bypass a rock step, continue up a 45 degree snow gully (small bivy ledge near the top), then climb about 500' of 50-55 degree snow/ice to reach the summit. The summit is a large, flat snowfield that makes an exposed but otherwise good bivy site. ,Descent: ,- From the summit head SE, bypassing a bergschrund. Traverse, downclimb and/or rappel diagonally across 40-50 degree snow/ice slopes below the ridge crest for about a half-mile to reach a small rock outcrop. Make two more rappels down snow/ice slopes to a level shoulder at 10,200' (good bivy site, but look out for cornices). ,- At the end of the shoulder make about a dozen rappels off rock anchors down the steepening S ridge, traversing between rappels if necessary to regain the ridge crest. At the base of the ridge make one or two rappels down snow slopes, then rappel or jump across a bergschrund to reach the glacier. Head SW down the glacier to return to base camp, making a wide detour to minimize exposure to icefall risk from a hanging glacier higher up. ,Protection ,An alpine rock rack, pickets and 4-6 ice screws. Most of the climbing is on rock and snow, but ice screws may be needed for the final 500' and the upper part of the descent. ,Puryear's guidebook suggests 1-3 days for the climb and 6-12 hours for the descent. Allow more time for the descent if the upper part of the SE ridge is mostly ice.,,",8, 5.8,An alpine rock rack and pickets.

Gear block? move up left on lichen wall of okay holds to face climb foot ramp diagonally sloping right corner (great pro) and go out after tree up the outside edge. Do an airy step right to new surface and face climb lower angled rock to the near summit of the buttress. No pro and up the ridge is a large pine on the left 15 feet more for belay. This is a mountaineers route. Damn serious one. Long run outs. A little safer after large toaster oven size rocks were found in the most dangerous way and had to be tossed off on the lead twice. This is the area where the longest naturally climbable rock is and didn't know until after doing it. Like the climbs of the nineteen thirties it has trees. Its a mountaineers classic and a bomb. Lots of variety in climbing and textures. The first section lay back area is the coolest. Good only for 30 feet and then the rock and things arise. It can be rappelled at the birch tree and flake slung. , ,Up right from 'Aurora Borealis',2 bolts to the start from Gifts to Attu, 1-4 tri cams, small amount of a full stopper range in sizes, small amount of # 2 camelots or friends up to #3.5, 1 pin in quartz section.

The climbing was surprisingly good (though QUITE dirty). I was thinking i had found a cool new virgin moderate when i came across a newly placed piton. This could only mean one thing, local obscurist Bradley White had been here. I looked in to it and decided I must have climbed his new route Old Yeller (5.6). He has since informed me otherwise and asked me to describe my line. So, here it is. ,From the ledge where Gifts From Attu starts, look up and 15ft right of the obvious corner for a flake/crack system above the birch tree growing out of the ledge. Climb up just right of the tree to gain the crack and layback your way up. after 35-40 feet place good gear and exit to the left and up to some small trees. Climb up left of the trees (in to a corner). Make an airy step left out on to a balancy low angle face and make a few moves to a small ledge and one more tricky spot to gain a large ledge. Here you will find a piton driven in to quartz. I moved way left here on to a very roomy ledge where you will find a thread anchor I left (this is above Aurora Borealis and Gifts From Attu).
